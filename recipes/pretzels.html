    <p><h4>If you've been craving the super savory Dot's pretzels—seasoned with buttermilk, butter, onion, garlic, and mustard—but can't find them near you, this recipe is a close second. We tried 4 different methods for replicating that buttery flavor and found starting with butter snaps pretzels is the best (and easiest!) way. But if you can't find those either, add 1 teaspoon butter extract to your seasoning mix.</h4></p>
    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup canola or peanut oil</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoons dry buttermilk powder</li>

        <li>8 ounces butter snaps pretzels</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).</li>
